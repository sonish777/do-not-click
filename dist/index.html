              Hi there, I hope you are having fun. You know last time I said, "I
              really wish i could see you one last time, one last cup of coffee,
              one last hug, and maybe lie in bed and fall asleep one last time.
              That would make me full and happy and in between we would forget
              everything, just for one last time, we'd have everything figured
              out... and during the in betweens, time would stop and we'd have
              forever and i'd never have to let you go". But there' no forever,
              and now i realize that if we keep adding up the "once mores", it
              will add up to a lifetime. And I'd like to belive that a lifetime
              is pretty enough. Though I tell myself often that I was lucky to
              have anytime with you at all. I tell myself " Whatever happens
              tomorrow, we've had today". I'd hate you lose you but if I ever
              do, I will make sure it happens for the best of you.
              <br />
              Anyway this is not about me, I hope you had a wonderful day at
              home. I just wanted to Thank you, for a lot of things. You came
              into my life just on time. I love you & I miss you just as much. I
              hope to see you soon. Happy birthday my dear.
              <br />
              Always !
            </p>
